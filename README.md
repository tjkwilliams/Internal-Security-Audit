# Internal-Security-Audit

**A Project Introduction:**
A company is growing and wants to expand to worldwide trade. I will be conducting a security audit that provides an overview of the risks/fines important to the company that will help better secure the company's security posture. I will focus on helping them with identifying and mitigating risk potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. Overview of the risks and/or fines

**Problem to Solve:** Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).
